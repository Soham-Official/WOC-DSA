Problem Statements:
1. 
2.
3.
4.
5.

Points to be noted while making a Proposal.
1. The intution of the code which you are going to implement. If you feel there is a use of any specific Data structure and Algorithm or both do mention them 
   so as to have a positive impact over other's proposal.
2. Clearly mention the time complexity and space complexity of the code which you are going to implement.
3. You have to write proposals including all problems.

Procedure after the proposals are selected.
Once your proposal will be selected you will be assigned to a group(Group number will be disclosed after the all the proposals are selected), where all the members 
have to collectively work on all the problem statement.
You will be given 1 test case for each problem and other testcases will be hidden.You will be awarded points on the number of hidden testcases your code passes.
If two teams score collide the team who submitted all the problems in least time will be ranked less than the other team.
